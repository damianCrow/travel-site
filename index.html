					<p><b>Sydney</b> is one of the most beautiful, hot and interesting cities i have ever seen.
						I visited for the first time at christmas 2013 for 2 weeks.
						Most of my time was spent on the nothern beaches but I also spent a few days in the city centre.
						The weather is warm the sea is blue and the food, though a little expencive, is generally very good.
						IF you can survive the 21 hour flight from London UK, I would recomend visiting Sydney
						(last visited December 2013).

				<p><b>London</b> Is reguarded by many people as one of the best cities in the world.
					I moved to east Lond in winter 1996. I have mixed feelings about this city.
					London can be amazing on a hot summer days spent in a park with friends.
					Unfortunately summer days here are quite rare.
